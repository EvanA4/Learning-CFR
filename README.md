This is more for myself, really. Here's a few scripts I wrote to learn CFR. Gotta start somewhere!

1. Check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWRXx2saLw4) which
explains the motivations for learning CFR!

2. [This PDF](http://modelai.gettysburg.edu/2013/cfr/cfr.pdf) then explains the
algorithm which CFR builds on top ofâ€”regret matching.

3. [Professor Bryce](https://www.youtube.com/@csprof/videos) then explains the concepts of CFR in an incredibly digestible
way. Watch videos AGT 23 to 26!

4. [Jonathan Gardner's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE7V8e77vg4) builds on
Prof. Bryce's teachings and gives recommendations on how to program Kuhn Poker with
CFR.
